# How-to-Make-Polar-CNC-Drawing-Machine

Hello friends welcome back in this new instructbales

Here I have made a simple Polar CNC drawing machine, I kept is as simple as possible complete structure is made out of wood.

I avoid to use 3D printer to keep it simple, so anyone can made it. So basically you think what is polar CNC means, 

so I will tell polar CNC's are quit different in comparison of traditional CNC,

Polar CNC are work in 360 degree format while traditional CNC are work in Cartesian coordinate system like X, Y & Z axis. 

In this this machine the Y axis (turn table) is polar format,

I have used a Custom made PCB to give professional look to my project, I ordered my PCB from JLCPB.COM they have very affordable rates for PCB like 2$ for 10PCB

Also there are not charging any extra fees for color PCB. $2 for 10 PCBs (Any Color): https://jlcpcb.com

## WHAT IS POLAR CNC MACHINE ##

So first of we have a question in mind that what is polar CNC right, and how it is different from our 
standerd CNC machine.
SO let me explain you in normal 2 or 3 Axis CNC machine all axis are have liner motion only.
Like X-axis moves left & right Y-axis movies backward and forward, and Z - axis moves UP & DOWN
But in this polar CNC machine the table of CNC machine
or the Y-axis of CNC machine is not moving left and right or backward & forward 
it is moving in circular motion, yes Y-axis is directly connected with the stepper motor
stepper motor rotates the Y--axis in circulation path.

##  COMPONENTS ##

Arduino Nano :- https://amzn.to/2UOWLMW

Nema 17:- https://amzn.to/2TNPUa8

Servo :- https://amzn.to/2TZqUfw

## SOFTWARE & FIRMWARE ##

ou need arduino IDE to upload code to arduino

and need a special software to process normal G-code to polar G-code Special thanks to bdring they have 

developed a software which can convert normal G-code into Polar G-code..
